They met the three sisters Haru, Kotose and Yukina, who run the cafe “Famille”, and he starts working there in exchange for a bed to sleep in.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Shou follows Haru far away from the town to a hill covered with flowers as far as the eye could see. He watched as a little girl whom Haru was embracing turned into a flower under the large moonlit tree. She noticed his presence and smiled lonesomely while looking fondly at the beautiful flowers in full bloom.\n\n“I have survived up till now in this world by doing this. But I still want to continue living… even if it’s in exchange for other people’s lives.”\n\nShou looked up at the petals which fluttered down and responded:\n\n“No matter what this world forces upon you, no matter how many people won’t forgive you... I’ll still pray for this world to end.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/november-2016-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Subarashiki Hibi is a story told in seven chapters. The story follows a group of several Tokyo high school students mostly through July of 2012 and each chapter is told from the perspective of one of its five main characters. Because of the same timeframe coverage, certain events are overlapping from chapter to chapter but at the core of it all is a mystery revolving around the prophecy about the end of the world on July the 20th as well as the events that are following before the said date. The first part of the VN is used to make a setting for the said mysteries while the second part is about uncovering the truth behind them all.\n\nThe story begins in chapter #1, 'Down the Rabbit-Hole I\" on July 12, 2012. The protagonist, Minakami Yuki, lives a peaceful everyday life with Tsukasa and Kagami, her childhood friends, when one day she meets a mysterious girl, Takashima Zakuro (a girl in another class in Yuki's school, who seems to have met Yuki before but Yuki doesn't remember her). The strange schoolmate Yuki just befriended moves into her house (Yuki doesn't mind too much about that). Then following this new guest in Minakami's residence, Yuki's two childhood friends mentioned earlier also move in, just so that they don't feel left out. These events are just a prelude for what will ultimately lead Yuki to discover her own \"Wonderful Everyday\" during this chapter.\n\nIn chapter #2, [spoiler]\"Down the Rabbit-Hole II\", the story still follows Minakami Yuki in the same timeline as before albeit with a different set of events and their outcomes. This time, Yuki learns that Takashima Zakuro has killed herself. Rumours in school are abuzz about predictions of the end of the world in 2012 - one of which is a Web site called the \"Web Bot Project\", a network of crawlers designed to harness the 'collective unconsciousness' to make predictions. A boy in Yuki's class named Mamiya Takuji stands up and makes an apocalyptic prediction, stating that the world will end on the 20th, that Zakuro's death was the first sign. He speaks of an event he dubs \"the End Sky\", where the world will be destroyed and reborn. The clock is ticking and more people die as the prophesied date draws closer and closer while Yuki attempts to get to the bottom of the identity of Mamiya Takuji, the Web Bot Project and the End Sky.[/spoiler]\n\n[Edited from Asceai's [url=http://www.menhelmate.org/2010/04/subarashiki-hibi-furenzoku-sonzai.html]review[/url]]",

      "description": "This is the debut game for Uguisu Kagura, which succeeds Yonaki Uguisu. There was a small library on that island. It was the Yuugyouji family’s private library built solely for one girl, Yoruko, who didn’t attend school and spent all her time there. With lots of intriguing books on its shelves, there was no happier place for a bookworm like her. There were also other wonderful and pleasant people who resided there: the protagonist Ruri and his cool sharp-tongued imouto Kisaki, the freeloading tennen moodmaker Rio, and the curious and honest “detective” Kanata. It’s as if they were all brought together by someone or something. Their love of books was the beginning of their youth. Before long, the lonely library became full of light and they became close like childhood friends.\n\nTwo years later, Ruri returned to the library after leaving the island due to family matters. Nothing seemed to have changed from six years ago, except that there was a secret which they were not aware of back then: “Anything that is written in the magic book will become reality”. If it’s a romance novel, then a miracle-like love story will unfold. If it’s a fantasy novel, then vampires will appear the next day. If it’s a horror novel, then there’ll be a ghost beckoning you from behind.\n\nYoruko’s strong will. Kisaki’s beauty. Rio’s cheerfulness. Kanata’s brilliance. Let’s fall in love with them and books.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2014/12/18/december-2014-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

It was an overly common battle tale. However, no one thanked or praised them for their victory. In fact, no one even knew them at all. Even so, the future of humanity was protected and it came to a happy end.\n\nNow around ten years later, it was spring, the season of meetings and farewells. Those who had once saved the world have forgotten ‘magic’ and lived as normal girls with ordinary encounters and problems. Taiga was approached by the transfer student Haru, who made a request of him:\n\n“Please turn me back into a mahou shoujo.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2019/01/01/january-2019-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",

      "description": "Kunimi Koutarou is a second-year student at Mikagegaoka Gakuen who is part of the literature club. He dreams of becoming a novelist, but he is unable to write a romance novel because of a first love trauma when he was small.\n\nThis spring, Mikagegaoka Gakuen was merged with two other schools, Sakuradai Gakuen and Mikagegaoka Nishi Gakuen. Koutarou found himself sitting in between Sena, his former love who had moved away, and Ayane, his best friend a few years ago who hadn’t talked to him since a certain incident.\n\nNow his regular days suddenly turn into those like you would only see in romance novels...\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/october-2015-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

He doesn't attend his club, he doesn't put much effort in his studies, all he does is show up at his part time job; in short, his life could be better. One day, he meets a strange girl, Kirari Shiino, at work and before he knows it, they've formed a punk band.\n\nThe band consists of Shikanosuke, Kirari, his childhood friend Chie Isurugi, and a rich but weak young lady by the name of Sarina Kashiwara. The four of them are members of the Second Literature Club, which has hardly any active members and is already scheduled to be disbanded. This band is their chance to stand out and give one final farewell at the Culture Festival.\n\nThe challenge was foolhardy, but after eccentric training they managed to succeed and rock out the peaceful Oubi Academy with their debut performance. That should have been it.\nThey were satisfied.\nThey should have returned to their normal lives.\nHowever, their final performance at a local Live House became a hit on the Internet and requests for their performance start flying in from far and wide.\n\nOne problem: exams are coming up and their parents are opposed to the band!\n\nWho cares!\n\nThe four of them embark on their final adventure, a long tour of Japan, armed with their dreams and their instruments, all aboard a rickety van that could fall apart at any moment.\n\n\"First stop, Nagoya!\"\n\n[From [url=http://www.mangagamer.com/r18/Titles/Details/2609C708-8684-42E1-92F0-17ED568F3CED/kirakira]Mangagamer[/url]]",

He reluctantly shows up in order to fulfill his graduation requirements.\n\nIt's December, and the first snow of the year has fallen. In one lot of the old town, Hatsuyuki encounters a beautiful girl wearing a white dress. She's wandering the streets under the falling snow, in search of her rabbit. A few days later, the girl in the dress, Sakura, transfers into his school, in order to take Hatsuyuki along towards the last winter.\n\nWith the turn of the four seasons, 1095 days come to an end. Soon winter will pass, and spring will arrive. Embracing memories of snow that never accumulated, the youth stands perfectly still.\n\nFrom the first snow (Hatsuyuki) to cherry blossoms (Sakura), congratulations on your graduation.",

She lives alone except for her pet dog Qoo, and she holds down a part-time job as a waitress at Dragon Burger. Her life is busy and content, but sometimes she feels like there's something she's forgetting, something she left undone. Maybe even something important.\n\nOne day Alice and her friends visit the clock tower. There, an unusual book falls into Alice's lap: the diary of a mysterious and rather perverted young man. Why do all the girls Alice meets show up in the diary? Why does nobody remember the events in the diary? And why does Alice feel so strongly that she wants to meet that young man?",
