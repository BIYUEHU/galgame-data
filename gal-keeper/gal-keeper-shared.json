      "description": "A long time ago, a group of special girls known as ‘mahou shoujos’ saved the world after a fierce battle where blood and tears were shed and prayers were made. It was an overly common battle tale. However, no one thanked or praised them for their victory. In fact, no one even knew them at all. Even so, the future of humanity was protected and it came to a happy end.\n\nNow around ten years later, it was spring, the season of meetings and farewells. Those who had once saved the world have forgotten ‘magic’ and lived as normal girls with ordinary encounters and problems. Taiga was approached by the transfer student Haru, who made a request of him:\n\n“Please turn me back into a mahou shoujo.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2019/01/01/january-2019-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",
